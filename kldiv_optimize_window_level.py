# example of performing an entropy-optimized window/level on a radiograph
# use Gradio to display this

import torch

# 1. load an example image

# 2. construct the model: image -> histogram -> entropy -> KLDivLoss
def entropy_window_level(img):
    pass

# construct the optimizer

# perform optimization

# display the result
